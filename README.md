# P2PConnect

P2PConnect is a project designed to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) connections for real-time data sharing, messaging, or file transfer between users without relying on a central server. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and example usage for establishing and managing secure P2P connections.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:**  
  Connect directly with other peers for fast and decentralized data exchange.

- **Real-Time Messaging:**  
  Send and receive messages instantly between connected peers.

- **File Transfer Support:**  
  Transfer files securely and efficiently over P2P connections.

- **NAT Traversal:**  
  Techniques such as STUN/TURN (if implemented) to work across different network environments.

- **Secure Connections:**  
  End-to-end encryption (if implemented) to ensure data privacy and security.

- **Cross-Platform:**  
  Designed to work on multiple platforms (update with specifics: e.g., Python, JavaScript, or specify frameworks used).
